### TODO

Some things we will hopefully get to one day.

- simulator
  - JIT based implementation
  - `get` for any expression
  - better debugging, add option to print expressions with trace
  - waveform generation
  - quickly update only parts of the circuit
- use [baa](https://github.com/ekiwi/baa) to represent and compute with concrete values
  - this will allow us to implement a more efficient witness struct
